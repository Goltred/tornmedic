# TC Helper - Medic Assistant

This simple chrome extension aims to assist potential revivers by
removing members on the faction page that are not optimal targets
for revives.

Currently, the extension hides:
* Members that are Okay
* Members that are Traveling
* Members that are in Jail
* Members that are Offline

The intent is to only display members that are:
* In Hospital
* Active (Green Status Icon)
* Inactive (Yellow Status Icon)

## Extra features

If this becomes more useful, some extra features can be added.
Some things in mind:
* Checkboxes to modify filtered people on faction page
* Summary box in Faction page that displays number of people filtered
** This also would give people a visual cue that the list is being filtered
* A settings box somewhere that allows to apply this only for particular factions
